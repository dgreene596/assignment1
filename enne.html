<p style=font-family:"Arial"><b>The Busy, Variety-Seeking type:<br>
Spontaneous, Versatile, Acquisitive, and Scattered
For more about the meaning of the arrows, see below.</b><br><br>
Sevens are extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. Playful, high-spirited, and practical, they can also misapply their many talents, becoming over- extended, scattered, and undisciplined. They constantly seek new and exciting experiences, but can become distracted and exhausted by staying on the go. They typically have problems with impatience and impulsiveness. At their Best: they focus their talents on worthwhile goals, becoming appreciative, joyous, and satisfied.<br><br>
•	<b>Basic Fear: </b>Of being deprived and in pain<br><br>
•	<b>Basic Desire: </b>To be satisfied and content—to have their needs
fulfilled<br><br>
•	<b>Enneagram Seven with a Six-Wing: </b> “The Entertainer”<br><br>
•	<b>Enneagram Seven with an Eight-Wing:</b> “The Realist”<br><br>
<b>Key Motivations: </b>Want to maintain their freedom and happiness, to avoid missing out on worthwhile experiences, to keep themselves excited and occupied, to avoid and discharge pain.<br><br>
<b>The Meaning of the Arrows (in brief)</b><br>
When moving in their Direction of Disintegration (stress), scattered Sevens suddenly become perfectionistic and critical at One. However, when moving in their Direction of Integration (growth), gluttonous, scattered Sevens become more focused and fascinated by life, like healthy Fives.<br>
<b>Examples: </b>John F. Kennedy, Benjamin Franklin, Leonard Bernstein,Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Elizabeth Taylor, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Steven Spielberg, Federico Fellini, Richard Feynman, Timothy Leary,Robin Williams, Jim Carey, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Bette Midler, Chuck Berry, Elton John, Mick Jagger, Gianni Versace, Liza Minelli, Joan Collins,Malcolm Forbes, Noel Coward, Sarah Ferguson, Larry King, Joan Rivers,Regis Philbin, Howard Stern, John Belushi, and “Auntie Mame” (Mame).<br><br>
We have named this personality type The Enthusiast because Sevens are enthusiastic about almost everything that catches their attention. They approach life with curiosity, optimism, and a sense of adventure, like “kids in a candy store” who look at the world in wide-eyed, rapt anticipation of all the good things they are about to experience. They are bold and vivacious, pursuing what they want in life with a cheerful determination. They have a quality best described by the Yiddish word “chutzpah”—a kind of brash “nerviness.”<br><br>
Although Sevens are in the Thinking Center, this is not immediately apparent because they tend to be extremely practical and engaged in a multitude of projects at any given time. Their thinking is anticipatory: they foresee events and generate ideas “on the fly,” favoring activities that stimulate their minds—which in turn generate more things to do and think about. Sevens are not necessarily intellectual or studious by any standard definition, although they are often intelligent and can be widely read and highly verbal. Their minds move rapidly from one idea to the next, making Sevens gifted at brainstorming and synthesizing information. Sevens are exhilarated by the rush of ideas and by the pleasure of being spontaneous, preferring broad overviews and the excitement of the initial stages of the creative process to probing a single topic in depth.<br><br></p>
